        Brochure websites allow businesses to showcase key information,
        testimonials, and updates, making them an ideal solution for businesses
        that rely on local customer engagement. With the majority of consumers
        researching businesses online before visiting in person, having a
        professional online presence is crucial.

      <h3 class="feature__heading">Why Choose a Brochure Website?</h3>
      <p>
        A brochure website provides your business with a strong online presence,
        allowing you to showcase key details such as services, pricing, and
        contact information. These sites are perfect for businesses that don’t
        require complex databases but still want to maintain a professional
        image.

        According to a recent survey,

        look at a business's online presence before visiting in person, and

          target="_blank"
          class="underline effect"
          >84% of consumers</a
        >
        believe that a business with a website is more credible than one that
        only has a social media profile.
      </p>
      <p>
        Our custom-coded brochure websites ensure your business appears credible
        and accessible to potential customers, making them an excellent choice
        for local customer engagement.

      <h3 class="feature__heading">No Monthly Fees</h3>
      <p>
        Many websites are built using website builders like WordPress or Wix,
        which come with ongoing subscription costs. We eliminate those fees by
        creating websites from scratch, providing you with a fully functional,
        secure website without the burden of monthly charges.
      </p>
      <p>
        All of our websites include a free SSL security certificate, which
        enhances your site's security and is favored by search engines like
        Google. This can save you an additional €80-130 per year compared to
        other platforms.

      <h3 class="feature__heading">Our Approach</h3>
      <p>
        Our unique approach involves fully creating a website before engaging in
        extended design discussions. This streamlined process saves both time
        and money for our clients, focusing on getting your business online as
        quickly as possible.
      </p>
      <p>
        Once your website is live, we can work on refining the design to meet
        your specific needs, ensuring that your online presence is effective and
        user-friendly.

        optimize your site's visibility on search engines, ensuring that your

      </p>
      <p>
        My websites are custom-coded from scratch, meaning there are no monthly
        subscription fees (like websites built using Squarespace, Wix or
        WordPress). Just a one time payment for a fully functional, secure, and
        high-quality website. That's it. It's yours.
      </p>
      <p>
        Everything is managed personally by me - from the initial consultation
        to website delivery. I work closely with every client to ensure a smooth
        and tailored experience, ensuring you are happy with every step of the
        process. You'll always have a direct point of contact, and I'm here to
        support your website long after it goes live.
