I called him up last minute to do a job that another sparky came to my house and couldn‚Äôt complete and he had reshuffled his day and was at my house and had the job completed within a couple of hours! Very fair pricing and he did an excellent job consulting me on where I wanted things and giving me different options to make sure I was happy with the job. Very thankful that good old fashioned service still exists. I wish Ahmed the very best for his business in the future. Will definitely be recommending him to locals in the coburg and northern suburbs. Thanks so much Ahmed! 5/5 stars!",
