      <p>
        I specialize in custom coding websites for small local businesses! My
        goal is to build lightweight websites that give customers an effective
        online presence without the complexity or expense of platforms like Wix
        or Squarespace. When you choose SX4 (me!), you’re opting for a simple,
        cost-effective solution with no ongoing monthly fees. My websites are
        perfect for businesses that provide an in person service. You can claim
        a free website design for your business by filling out the form below!

        Websites are key for making sure your business is easily found on
        Google, and even more importantly in 2024, on Google Maps! SX4 websites
        are perfect for creating a digital presence where customers can see key
        details like services, pricing, and contact information, all without the
        need for complex databases or monthly fees!

      <h3>Not Convinced? Worried There's a Catch?</h3>
      <p>
        I know it can be daunting to trust a randomer off the internet! That's
        why I would love the oppurtunity to hop on a video call for a chat (or
        meet in person if you are based in Melbourne) to prove that I am not
        some scammer or bad guy!

      <p>
        Instead of website builders like Wix or Squarespace, which charge
        monthly subscription fees just to exist, I code each website from
        scratch. This allows you to avoid any monthly charges. When your website
        is ready, it’s fully yours. It also comes with a SSL security
        certificate to enhance security and improve your Google ranking.

      <h3 class="feature__heading">One Time Fee, No Nonsense Service</h3>
      <p>
        I take a unique approach that focuses on simplicity and speed. I’ll
        create the website first, working with you to make sure it matches what
        you have in mind. This way, you get online quickly and save both time
        and money. Once your website is live, I’ll be available to make tweaks
        and refinements to ensure it looks and functions exactly how you want.
      </p>
      <p>
        For a one-time fee, I customize your site to fit your business needs,
        maintain it so you don’t have to worry about the technical side, and
        help establish a professional online presence that attracts local
        customers. It’s a no-nonsense, hassle-free service with a single
        payment—just like the good old days before subscriptions!

      <h3 class="feature__heading">Google Tools</h3>
      <p>
        Every website I create comes with Google Analytics and Google Search
        Console already set up. These tools let you keep an eye on site traffic
        and optimize how your website shows up in searches. Plus, I’ll provide
        monthly reports so you’re always informed about your site’s performance.

        I started out by helping a friend get their business online, and I’ve
        been dedicated to supporting small businesses ever since. I’m here to
        make launching a website easy and affordable. When you need updates or
        maintenance, I’m just a message away to keep your site current as your
        business grows.
