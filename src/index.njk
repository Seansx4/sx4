        Welcome! If you're reading this, it's likely because I've already
        reached out to you. My name is Sean (blue jumper), and I run SX4.

        I’m a passionate web developer who specializes in creating simple yet
        effective brochure websites for local businesses. My focus is on helping
        small businesses establish an online presence without breaking the bank.
        By using efficient platforms and streamlined processes, I’m able to keep
        costs low and quality high.

      <p>
        Think of a brochure website as your business card on the web—simple,
        sleek, and effective. These lightweight websites are perfect for local
        businesses that want a professional online presence without complexity.

        In a world where consumers are returning to favoring websites over apps
        and social media profiles, having a website is more important than ever.

          >recent survey</a
